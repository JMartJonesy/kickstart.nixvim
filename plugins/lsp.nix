    # Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
    #
    # LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
    #
    # LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
    # and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
    #
    # In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
    # language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
    # (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
    # processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
    #
    # LSP provides Neovim with features like:
    #  - Go to definition
    #  - Find references
    #  - Autocompletion
    #  - Symbol Search
    #  - and more!
    #
    # Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
    # Neovim which are configured below in the `server` section.
    #
    # If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
    # and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

      #  - cmd: Override the default command used to start the server
      #  - filetypes: Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
      #  - capabilities: Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
      #  - settings: Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
      #        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/
