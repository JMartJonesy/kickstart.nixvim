## Introduction

This repo is a personal project to learn Nix & Nixvim within NixOS while also learning/setting up [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
I have attempted to be as true to kickstart as possible while adding new and updated comments to help those learning Nix.

### Caveats

1. Nix does not lend itself to the same separation paradigms used by kickstart.nvim. The idea of keeping the configuration as a single file
similar to kickstart.nvim was originally planned but as I translated more of the init.lua over I found Nix lended itself better to a more
modular implementation. This means most plugins have their own .nix files that are imported into the base nixvim.nix file.
2. I used as little lua code as possible in the .nix files but due to Nixvim being a relatively new Nix module not everything can be natively configured. Any lua code will slowly be removed as new Nixvim features come out that allow for native methods of configuation.
3. I did not include Lazy nor Mason as I felt those both went against the Nix philosophy of having all your dependencies installed and managed through the .nix files. While it is possible to configure Lazy in Nixvim the implementation is very limited at the moment. Further enhancements to Lazy which would allow lazy loading are being discussed [here](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim/issues/421) and I may update this repo to use Lazy when these features are implemented.
4. kickstart.nixvim is somewhat slower than kickstart.nvim, some of this has to do with the fact that this repo is not using Lazy. I'll have to do futher investigation to identify how else to speed up this implementation.

# Installation

This installation process assumes you understand the basics of importing and adding dependencies to your .nix configuration files.

## Install External Dependencies

- Basic utils: `git`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `have_nerd_font` in `nixvim.nix` to true
- Language Dependencies:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you will need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

## Overview

You can use this repo in four ways:

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standalone Neovim| Run a bundled Neovim executable with kickstart.nixvim config, no setup |
| NixOS Module     | System-level integration on NixOS                                      |
| Home Manager     | User-level integration on any OS using Home Manager                    |
| nix-darwin       | User-level integration on macOS using nix-darwin                       |

## Use-cases

### 1. Standalone Usage (No Configuration Needed)

Run instantly without modifying any user or system configuration:

```sh
nix run github:JMartJonesy/kickstart.nixvim
```
Or build it locally:
```sh
nix build github:JMartJonesy/kickstart.nixvim
./result/bin/nvim
```

### 2. NixOS Module
1. Add kickstart.nxivim to your `flake.nix`:
```nix
inputs.kickstart-nixvim.url = "github:JMartJonesy/kickstart.nixvim";
```
2. Import the nixosModules in your `configuration.nix`:
```nix
{
  imports = [
    inputs.kickstart-nixvim.nixosModules.default
  ];

  programs.nixvim.enable = true;
}
```

### 3. Home Manager Module
1. Add kickstart.nxivim to your `flake.nix`:
```nix
inputs.kickstart-nixvim.url = "github:JMartJonesy/kickstart.nixvim";
```
2. Import the homeManagerModules in your `home.nix`:
```nix
{
  imports = [
    inputs.kickstart-nixvim.homeManagerModules.default
  ];

  programs.nixvim.enable = true;
}
```

### 4. nix-darwin Module (macOS)
1. Add kickstart.nxivim to your `flake.nix`:
```nix
inputs.kickstart-nixvim.url = "github:JMartJonesy/kickstart.nixvim";
```
2. Import the darwinModules in your `darwin-configuration.nix`:
```nix
{
  imports = [
    inputs.kickstart-nixvim.darwinModules.default
  ];

  programs.nixvim.enable = true;
}
```
## Local configuration

>**NOTE**
> Backup your previous configuration (if any exists)
> This can be found on Linux under the path `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim` or `~/.config/nvim`

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can update and version control.
2. Clone kickstart.nixvim
    * If you created your own fork
      ```sh
      cd ~
      git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/kickstart.nixvim.git
      ```
3. Update your flake.nix to refer to your local kickstart.nixvim repo
```nix
inputs.kickstart-nixvim.url = "path:<PATH_TO>/kickstart.nixvim";
```
5. Rebuild your NixOS configuration
6. Confirm your init.lua file has been created and loads without errors
```sh
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
``` 

# FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart.nixvim?
  * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, move your old configuration to
    `~/.config/nvim-backup` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-backup='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-backup" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-backup` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-backup`.
* What if I want to "uninstall" kickstart.nixvim:
   1. Remove kickstart-nixvim from your `flake.nix` and the module imports from you `configuration.nix`, `home.nix`, or `darwin-configuration.nix`
   2. Remove the kickstart.nixvim directory `rm -r ~/<PATH_TO>/kickstart.nixvim`
   3. Remove any .local nvim files `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
   4. **Optional:** Move your previously backed up lua configuration files to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim` or `~/.config/nvim`
   5. Rebuild your NixOS configuration `nixos-rebuild switch`
