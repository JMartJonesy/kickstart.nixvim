  # Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
  #
  # LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
  #
  # LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
  # and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
  #
  # In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
  # language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
  # (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
  # processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
  #
  # LSP provides Neovim with features like:
  #  - Go to definition
  #  - Find references
  #  - Autocompletion
  #  - Symbol Search
  #  - and more!
  #
  # Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
  # Neovim which are configured below in the `server` section.
  #
  # If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
  # and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`
  #
  # https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/plugins/lsp/index.html

    # Enable the following language servers
    #  Feel free to add/remove any LSPs that you want here. They will automatically be installed.
    #
    #  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
    #  - cmd: Override the default command used to start the server
    #  - filetypes: Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
    #  - capabilities: Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
    #  - settings: Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
    #        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/
